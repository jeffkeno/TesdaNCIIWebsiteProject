						<p class="para" align="left"> Jean René Lacoste (2 July 1904 – 12 October 1996) was a French tennis player and businessman. 
						He was nicknamed "the Crocodile" because of how he dealt with his opponents he is also known worldwide as the creator of the Lacoste tennis shirt, 
						which he introduced in 1929. It was during one of René’s tennis games in the early 1930s, before the brand Lacoste has emerged. 
						He had spotted a crocodile skin suitcase in the store window of a nearby shop, and set his heart on the item. So he made a bet with the captain of the French Davis Cup team, where if he should he win the game, they would buy it for him.
						Unfortunately, René lost the match, so didn’t get his crocodile skin suitcase, but he did get a nickname. Both the press and the public continued to refer to René with the nickname “crocodile” and in a matter of weeks it had stuck. René had a crocodile embroidered onto his court blazer; 
						and then when he founded Lacoste clothing, it was obvious what he wanted the logo to be.
						From there, the famous Lacoste brand was born, with the crocodile logo always by its side.</p>

						lack creativity and The ATP is sponsored by FedEx (the governing body for mens pro tennis). Roger is arguably one of the greatest players within the ATP.
