						<h1 align="center" class="headings1">Maria Sharapova Return</h1>
						<p class="para" align="left"> On March 7,2016 Maria revealed that she had failed a drug test at Australian Open 2016.Sharapova,admitted to testing positive for meldonium, an 
						anti-ischemic drug usually prescribed for heart conditions,that was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'s banned substances list on January 1, 2016.She was suspended by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) from playing tennis with effect from March 12, 2016.
						On April 2017 Maria returned to WTA tour. She was given wild cards to compete in the following three WTA tournaments: Women's Stuttgart Open, Madrid Open and Italian Open. 
						She played her first match of her comeback on April 26 at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix,a tournament that she had previously won on three occasions. 
						Her first round opponent was Italian Roberta Vinci,who she went on to defeat in straight sets to advance
						to the second round, making it her first victory since her return. Her latest ranking in WTA number 146.</p>

						<h1 align="center" class="headings1">Serena Williams Hiatus</h1>
						<p class="para" align="left"> Serena Williams temporarily hangs up her tennis racquet. The world No. 1 tennis player is taking the rest of the year off hot on heels of her pregnancy announcement. Her representative confirms the hiatus to New York Times. 
						Williams, 35, is 20 weeks along. It's her first child with fiance Alexis Ohanian. The athlete and the Reddit co-founder have been together since 2015. 
						He popped the big question in a romantic proposal in Rome in December 2016.</p>

						<h1 align="center" class="headings1">Roger Federer grand slam 8th Wimbledon Title Record</h1>
						<p class="para" align="left"> The Swiss marvel, closing in on his 36th birthday, claimed a record eighth Wimbledon title on Sunday and his 19th Grand Slam win by utterly dominating Marin Cilic of Croatia in a 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 sweep. Federer was so overwhelming,
						he reduced the big-swinging 6-foot-6 Croatian to tears midway through the second set. Cilic continued, but was mentally broken with a pro-Federer crowd cheering on the ageless Swiss champion. Federer's win comes five years after his last triumph 
						at the All England Club and makes him Wimbledon's oldest men's champion of the modern era, succeeding Arthur Ashe who was nearly 32 when he won Wimbledon in 1975. He also moves past Pete Sampras and William Renshaw in what's still officially called Gentlemen's Singles. Sampras won all but one of his in the 1990s; Renshaw won each of his in the 1880s, back in the days when the previous year's champion advanced automatically 
						to the final and therefore was able to successfully defend a title with one victory.</p>
